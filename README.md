# Analysis_of_Deaths_Caused_by_Drug_Overdose

The ongoing challenge of drug overdose in the United States has been a focal point of attention for the past five decades. The allocation of $42.5 billion in the 2023 federal budget, representing an increase from the previous year, underscores the seriousness of the issue. In 2022, there were over 79,000 drug overdose-related deaths, surpassing fatalities from accidents, homicides, and suicides. Although the number of estimated deaths showed a slight decrease from 2021, it remained 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. The misuse of prescription medications, notably in Connecticut, has played a significant role, prompting a comprehensive investigation as part of my research.

Objective & Approach: My mission is to uncover the factors and trends driving drug abuse in Connecticut. To achieve this goal, I have developed a three-pronged approach.

Demographics Analysis: I have conducted an in-depth examination of factors such as age, gender, race, and location to identify potential correlations with drug consumption.

Temporal Patterns Study: I have explored annual trends, seasonal variations, and the preferred times for drug usage.

Causative Factors Diagnosis: Identifying the prevalent chemicals, frequently abused drugs, and key contributing categories responsible for 80% of cases is essential for understanding the root causes.

In essence, this research aims to shed light on the dynamics of drug abuse in Connecticut, paving the way for well-informed solutions.
